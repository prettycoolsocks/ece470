The overall goal of this semester project is to simulate a robot doing a task. For our team's project, we are simulating the filling of a pill organizer with medications. This specific READ ME file covers the installation of a robot simulation software (V-REP) and executing a basic scene where the robot articulates each joint.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

There are a few prerequisite knowledge and programs that will be required in order to accomplish the required steps. 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
